        <h1>Movie Review for the Tale of Princess Kaguya</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Tale of Princess of Kaguya is a 2013 Studio Ghibli 
            film directed by Isao Takahata. It is based on the 10th 
            century Japanese literary tale, the Tale of the Bamboo Cutter.  
            The story has multiple major themes, including coming of age,  
            feminism/autonomy, aristocracy, as well as freedom and 
            responsibility. While the film is animated, which makes the 
            film seem like it is geared towards younger audiences, 
            there is an allure to the film that appeals to everyone. 
            This may be due to the universality of the themes as well 
            as the small details that may be more noticed and appreciated 
            by older audiences, such as the subtle changes in art style and 
            music that reflects the emotion of the scenes. 

        </p>
        <p>
           Out of all the themes in the film, the one that stood out the most 
           to me was the opposing themes of freedom and responsibility, possibly 
           because it is one of the most relevant to my current life, as well 
           as to many around me. Thinking about this theme, I realize that 
           while the distinct artistic visuals of the film are especially 
           appealing, the connections one can make to their own lives also 
           contributes a lot to the attractiveness of this film. 
        </p>

        <h2>Plot Synopsis</h2>

        <p>
           The story begins with a bamboo cutter from a mountain village who 
           finds a small sprite inside a stick of bamboo. The sprite becomes 
           a human baby who the bamboo cutter and his wife raise as their 
           daughter. The baby grows remarkably fast, reinforcing the idea 
           that the baby from the bamboo is a miracle or comes from divinity. 
           The bamboo cutter is determined that the child is destined to be 
           royalty. The child, who is later given the name Kaguya, is raised 
           in the village and befriends the other village children as they 
           always play and explore together. She is especially close to and 
           eventually falls in love with Sutemaru, the elder brother figure 
           among the group of village children. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Kaguya stays in the village until the bamboo cutter finds gold and 
            luxurious fabrics in the bamboo grove. He takes it as a sign that 
            Kaguya should be raised as royalty instead of a normal village girl
            , so he uses the fabric to make extravagant colorful clothing and 
            the gold to move into the capital and build a palace for Kaguya. 
            He also hires an etiquette tutor and servants for her, allowing 
            her to live a complete aristocratic life. Despite the access to 
            luxury and her natural talent for aristocratic activities, like 
            playing instruments, Kaguya finds little enjoyment with this 
            lifestyle. She continuously longs for her previous carefree 
            village life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rumors of her talent and beauty attracted multiple high ranking 
            suitors, including the emperor himself. When suitors came to her, 
            she was not willing to marry anyone so she gave them impossible 
            requests as conditions for marriage. When the emperor went to see 
            Kaguya, the emperor tried to kidnap Kaguya. In that moment, she 
            discovered her ability to become invisible upon will. At night, 
            she prays to the moon to save her from this life. It is revealed 
            that she was originally from the moon and came to earth seeking to 
            experience human life. Once she realizes the moon people will come 
            to take her away, she tells her family. Her father, the bamboo 
            cutter, was willing to do anything to protect her and keep her on 
            earth. He built a wall and called for guards, however it was all 
            futile against the celestial beings who easily made all the mortals 
            unconscious. Kaguya eventually was forced back to the moon and her 
            memories were erased. 
        </p>

        <h2>The Moon</h2>

        <p>
            One of the most impactful scenes to me was the ending of the film 
            when it seemed like everything was torn away forcibly from Kaguya 
            and her family on earth. It is like awakening from a vivid dream 
            to a bleak reality (or having to leave a warm soft bed for an 8 am 
            class on a cold rainy dark morning…). The moon people show up as 
            all powerful figures at the end who are able to suppress any sort 
            of mortal efforts that go against their will. They are illustrated 
            as buddhist figures, one of the most common god-figures in Asian 
            myths and legends. The visual design of the moon people reinforces 
            their role in the story. They are floating on clouds as they enter 
            and are colored with pale colors, making them look more statuesque.
        </p>
        <iframe width="100%" height = "56%"

        </iframe>
        <p>
            These aspects emphasize their otherworldly-ness, as well as their role 
            as the hand of destiny in this story. The very perfect visualization of 
            them illustrates the moon as a happy place to be, yet Kaguya's sad 
            expression right before her memory is erased tells the story that the moon 
            is more of a prison than a paradise. This is in line with many mythological 
            interpretations of the moon around the world, as there are many stories 
            about people or animals being trapped on the moon. The moon in The Tale of 
            Princess Kaguya plays a special role in the story, as it is both her escape 
            from her suffering on earth and a place of restriction. 
        </p>
        <h2>Being Free</h2>
        <p>
           The film also pictures the colorfulness and potential of freedom in human life 
           very effectively. These moments in the film also stand out to me as they contrast 
           a lot with the more serious scenes of Kaguya in the palace. The use of music, 
           more saturated colors, and motion of the characters in the scene when Kaguya 
           reunites with Sutemaru is a prime example:
        </p>
        <iframe width = "100%" height = "56%"
         src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/AJguIZgw0Bs">
        </iframe>   
        <p>
            In this scene, Kaguya is finally able to reunite with Sutemaru after being 
            trapped in her aristocratic life for so long. Out of excitement and happiness, 
            they run and fly together. The point of view of the film moves with Kaguya and 
            Sutemaru as they fly, immersing the viewer into the surrounding scenery. Much 
            like other scenes depicting nature in the film, vibrant colors are used in the 
            background opposed to the more watered down colors of the backgrounds and vibrant 
            colors only used for the colors elsewhere. This brings forward the beauty found 
            in nature and emphasizes it as something that Kaguya loves about earth. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Even in her aristocratic life, she takes advantage of opportunities to reconnect 
           with the natural world. For example, gardening in her mother's garden and going 
           to see cherry blossoms. 
        </p>
        <iframe width ="100%" height = "56%"
         src ="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cms9yW6aAH4">
        </iframe>
        <p>
            These moments represent Kaguya's ability to find enjoyment in a life full of 
            restricting tasks and expectations. Similar to the flying scene, the cherry 
            blossom scene features more dynamic movement of the point of view and vibrant 
            colors. However, it focuses more on Kaguya and her enjoyment of the moment rather 
            than the entire surroundings. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the scene, a little kid bumps into Kaguya. While Kaguya does not 
            think much of it, the child's mother immediately apologizes profusely to Kaguya, 
            seeing that Kaguya was of higher social status. This action brings Kaguya back 
            to the reality of her restricting life. It is difficult to simply interact with 
            others due to the differences in status and wealth. The mood immediately dampens 
            because of this and she leaves with her mother and lady in waiting.
        </p>
        <h2>Being Caged</h2>
        <p>
            Among the more serious moments of the film, one of the most impactful is during 
            Kaguya's coming of age party. The celebration is meant to be for her yet she has 
            to stay in the background and watch all the invited aristocrats party from the 
            dark. The realization that everything was just for status and it had nothing to 
            do with genuine celebration led into a scene where Kaguya runs away from the 
            palace. 
        </p>
        <iframe width = "100%" height = "56%"
         src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jtc-PP2GWPo">
        </iframe>
        <p>
            The rougher lines become very distinct in this scene as they show darker emotions 
            and desperation to escape. The increased roughness in the art and animation style 
            emphasizes the rawness of the emotions felt in the scene. The scene also has 
            darker colors and increased shading compared to the usual lighter colors and 
            gradually becomes fully grayscale as Kaguya tosses away her colorful robes. This 
            illustrates the desperation to be free from the expectations of her new lifestyle 
            and return to her previous simple life. It also foreshadows her return to the moon, 
            as she is seen running towards the moon which is seen hanging low in the sky. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another part of Kaguya's coming of age that was especially memorable is when she 
            has to pluck her brows and paint her teeth black:
        </p>
        <iframe width = "100%" height = "56%" 
         src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiPWZXtVHdg">
        </iframe>
        <p>
            It is a part of her responsibility as an aristocratic girl to follow the 
            aristocratic beauty standards even if it seemed unnatural to her. She gains a 
            more powerful social status but actually loses power and autonomy over herself.
            At the end of the scene, she receives many gifts, including a bird in a cage. 
            Seeing the bird, she unlocks the cage and allows it to fly away. This can be 
            representative of her own desire to become free from her current life. 
        </p>
        <h2>Relevance</h2>
        <p>
            Freedom and responsibility are contrasted in the film through various methods 
            but there are some places where the line between the two becomes blurred and 
            complicated. Kaguya still finds ways to enjoy her life while taking care of 
            her new responsibilities. For example, when with her tutor, she finds 
            opportunities to fool around and entertain herself, however she acts completely
            differently when in front of an audience. The absence of one also does not 
            guarantee the presence of the other. When Kaguya escapes her restricting life 
            on earth, she just returns to another restricting life on the moon. This reflects 
            how freedom and responsibility can be to us in real life. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are times that responsibilities, such as studying and work feel like they 
            are restricting your freedom to do things, especially if there is extra pressure 
            added from parents or just the job market. On the flip side, taking advantage of 
            your freedom and realizing that technically no one is stopping you comes with 
            the guilt of not being productive and not working towards your responsibilities. 
            However, there are times that the two concepts are not polar opposites. 
            Like in college, you have some freedom over what you want you are responsible 
            for learning. Likewise, if you take the freedom to go out and explore, you will 
            have to take responsibility for yourself and your own safety.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depicted in the film, there is also a linear decrease in freedom, or even just the 
            enjoyment of life in general as Kaguya becomes older. Being a celestial being, Kaguya 
            grew up very fast, but her life events still followed that of a typical human on earth. 
            The enjoyment of exploration in childhood gradually disappears as more responsibilities 
            become present, making a simple care-free life out of reach.
        </p>
        <p>
           It can be easy to fall into a dark hole thinking about how life may never be the same 
           as when we did not know as much and did not have as many expectations to fulfill. This 
           may partially contribute to the impactfulness of the film, as it reminds many that 
           simplicity can be difficult to obtain. However, it is untrue that life will be miserable 
           with more responsibilities. There is joy in simplicity, but there can also be joy that 
           comes with understanding complexities and having autonomy over your life.(Also the thought 
           of never being given enough responsibilities to make enough money can be depressing). 
        </p>
        <h2>Final Remarks</h2>
        <p>
            Overall, I would recommend this film. The unique elements of the animation and art 
            style, as well as the soundtrack immerse viewers into the film effectively. Additionally, 
            it can leave viewers pondering about their own lives as they finish watching. 10/10, can 
            be depressing if you think too much, but very worth watching.
